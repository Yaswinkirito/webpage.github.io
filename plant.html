        <p style="font-size: 20px;">Plants are essential for the survival of humans but the forest cover our planet are reducing at an alarming rate but due to the effort of government agencies and various nonprofit organizations it has slowed down, but the growing needs of the increasing human population need to be satisfied so it will seem that the future will be made of concrete jungles, deserts…. these are the things that novels about the end of the world set in the future often states but it will seem that there is a possible future in which the world will covered with greenery. </p>
        <p style="font-size: 20px;">DNA based storage have been in frontier of the 21st century as a solution to the increasing need for a data storage solution 1 gram of DNA can store about an exabyte (1 billion GB) of data. Two undergraduate students successfully encoded a python program into the DNA of a plant and it’s was decoded from it’s seed successfully. Many companies have emerged in the recent years based on the idea of plant-based cloud storage. This method provides a viable alternative to the current method where data are stored in server farms which run on electricity made by fossil fuels. The above method is  not so difficult to understand since it is a simple conversion of machine code(binary language) to the four letter(A,T,G,C) code and it’s a medium which require a low maintenance.</p>
        <p style="font-size: 20px;">In UK full grown a company that grows trees in the form of chairs and sells them. The company was founded in 2005 and sold it’s first batch in 2015 most of them were pre-ordered also some tree grown in the form of lamp shades and hexagonal mirror frames were also sold. Maybe in the future with advancements in genetic engineering we could grow any furniture as we require instead of making them.</p>
